===========================================


Quick Start

Include "pinax-theme-classic" in your requirements file and
"pinax_theme_classic" in your INSTALLED_APPS.

Make sure both template loaders and staticfiles finders includes
app directories.

Site name comes from Sites fixture.

Your "site_base.html" should extend "theme_base.html" and should provide
"footer" and "nav" blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).

Your pages should have blocks "head_title" and "body" and should extend
"site_base.html".

The url name "home" should be defined as the homepage.


Forms
-----

To style forms, classic theme uses uni-form 
    
    {% load uni_form_tags %}

and do something like:

    <form method="POST" action="" class="uniForm">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <fieldset class="inlineLabels">
            {{ form|as_uni_form }}
             <div class = "form_block">
                 <input type="submit" name="action" />
            </div>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
